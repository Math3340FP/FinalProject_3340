Final Project for Math3340 on Real estate data

Abstract 
In this project, our focus is to evaluate the relationship between variables given in the dataset and examine if certain variables are directly and largely affect the house price of the unit area. Firstly, we visualized the dataset that contains a total of 415 observations (414 original plus 1 new data point). Followed by the summary of methods we used to analyze individual variables, methods used are Backward, Stepwise, Both and Subset Regression. Results in both Backward and Stepwise methods are essentially identical, which suggests the longitude does not affect house prices as significantly as other variables does. Meanwhile, in order to ensure the viability of our final model, it was tested in several ways under Gauss-Markov Assumption. Finally, a list of results, conclusions and limitations will be discussed in detail.
