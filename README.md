The price movement of houses has gained much more attention than previous days. House prices are not only the economic reflection of a certain country, but also an important thing that affects people’s daily life. A precise prediction on the house prices can benefit both buyers and sellers. Therefore, a house price prediction model is necessary for improving the efficiency of real estimates and fills up information gaps for a variety of people. According to the research by (V. Limsombunchai, C. Gan, & M. Lee, “House price prediction: Hedonic price model”. American Journal of Applied Sciences, 1 (3), 193-20, 2004), the results suggest houses with more bedrooms and bathrooms are more expensive. A new house has a relatively higher price compared to an old house. Many recent studies also justify that different locations of the houses could be a determining factor of the prices of the houses. For example, the houses are usually more expensive if they are surrounded by bus stops and convenience stores.

The previous research (P. Linneman, “An empirical test of the efficiency of the housing market”. Journal of Urban Economics 20(1986): 140-154, 1986.) finds empirical evidence to prove the house price is closely related to a wide variety of economic variables such as people’s income, cost of construction etc.
From the results of all the research above, it is obvious to see there are numerous different factors that contribute differences in the house price. Thus, we need to do a detailed analysis on the given dataset to determine which variable has the greatest correlation with the house price of the unit area.
